You're a jerk, Thom.
0:25
Look Celia, we have to follow our passions;
0:27
...you have your robotics, and I just want to be awesome in space.
0:30
Why don't you just admit that you're freaked out by my robot hand?
0:34
I'm not freaked out by- it's...
0:37
...alright! Fine!
0:38
I'm freaked out! I have nightmares that I'm being chased...
0:41
...by these giant robotic claws of death...
0:43
Whatever, Thom. We're done.
0:50
Robot's memory synced and locked!
1:01
This is pretty freaky.
1:57
Shouldn't you be down there?
2:11
I heard you guys talking last night.
2:16
It's not my fault, you know.
3:11
Are you ready?
3:13
Of course you're ready, you're a rockstar.
3:17
How's it looking, Barley?
3:19
We should have about ten minutes...
3:21
Well that's perfect.
3:23
We're on in one! All systems go! Yeah you, go!
3:28
Go! Move your asses! Go go go!
3:33
I love it! Come on, go!
3:43
That's nice.
3:44
Nothing to worry about.
3:46
Thom.
3:51
There she is.
3:53
Now.
3:55
You love her.
3:57
She is your passion!
4:00
Be tender to her.
4:01
Be honest! Eh- be tender.
4:05
Remind her what love is.
4:52
...and, action!
4:56
Memory overwrite in progress!
4:59
You're a jerk, Thom!
5:02
Ohp- Sorry! Sorry.
5:16
Look Celia.
5:18
We have to follow our passions.
5:21
You have your robotics...
5:25
...and I just want to be awesome in space.
5:39
Okay, they're coming. Two minutes left!
5:43
Speed it up, Thom!
5:45
Vivacissimo!
5:47
Why don't you just admit that you're freaked out by my robot hand?
5:56
Listen Celia, I was young...
5:59
...and a dick.
6:01
But that's no reason to destroy the world.
6:05
Why does he do this?
6:06
We already tried that one!
6:11
Abort!
6:13
Cut!
6:14
Whoaaa!
6:19
Whoaaa!
6:21
Nooooo!
6:23
You broke my heart.
6:26
I know.
6:27
You forgot me on earth.
6:29
I know.
6:30
I should just crush you.
6:36
I'm-
6:47
I'm sorry.
6:50
Good ad-lib.
6:59
Not my fault!
7:02
This time.
7:08
Quiet on set!
7:10
We're out of time!
8:13
Come on!
8:22
RAAAAAAAAH!
8:24
Memory overwrite, 90%.
8:26
Captain! We have to abort!
8:38
The world's changed, Celia...
8:54
...maybe we can too.
8:58
Memory overwrite complete!
9:19
You know.
9:22
There's a lesson to be learned from this.
9:26
Could'a gone worse.
